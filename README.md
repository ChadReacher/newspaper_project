# Newspapers project <br/>

## Project description
This application presents a web-site which allows common users
to create their own magazines and write different articles.
This site I built as a pet project to practice my new skills
and dive deeper into Java and Spring. <br/>
## Technologies
In this site I used Java and its framework Spring, especially
Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf.
For the database I chose PostgreSQL as I used it earlier in my last projects.
As a main build automation tool I used Maven. <br/>

## Difficult coding parts and future ideas about the project
The most difficult part of creating the website was implementing
authentication through web forms because it was my first time to do it using html forms.
In the near future it'd be a good idea to add some tests.


## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/ChadReacher/newspaper_project.git`
- Open the project in any Java IDE;
- Run the application;
